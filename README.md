===========

IDSgrep ([overview](http://tsukurimashou.sourceforge.jp/idsgrep.php.en), [manual](http://tsukurimashou.sourceforge.jp/idsgrep.pdf), [academic paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5585)) is a tool for running "grep"-like text searches in databases of Chinese characters. This repository contains the output of IDSgrep looking up the IDS decompositions of 3,028 "essential" Japanese kanji (the 2200 jōyō kanji plus a few hundred more), ordered according to James Heisig's *Remembering the Kanji,* 6th edition. Each character is linked to a more visual, indented tree-like representation of its IDS decomposition, also generated by IDSgrep. Finally, this repository contains a plain-text file with the same data as the HTML file.

"IDS" here refers to Unicode's ideographic description sequences, a comprehensive analysis of which is given in the IDSgrep documentation.

This use of IDSgrep barely exercises its features. IDSgrep is essentially being used to look up characters in the [CJKVI Project](https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-data)'s database of Chinese character components, which is included in IDSgrep.

**Acknowledgements** Besides IDSgrep and CJKVI, as well as James Heisig's books for a sensible sorting order, I use Pádraig Brady's `ansi2html.sh` to preserve IDSgrep's colorized output in HTML.
